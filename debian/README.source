unicap for Debian
=================

# obtaining upstream sources
Traditionally, the Debian "unicap" package contains the "libunicap" component
of the unicap project.
Now, upstream no longer provides downloadable files for the various unicap
components.  Instead, everything was moved into a single big repository on
GitHub, with the components being subdirectories.

Each component uses different release cycles and versions.
However, due to the way GitHub works, one cannot download a single component
from a full repository.
Additionally, recent releases have not been tagged yet.

For the time being, the upstream source is manually extracted from the
repository, with something like:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/unicap/unicap.git
cd unicap
SHA=$(git log -1 --pretty=format:%h libunicap)
DATE=$(git log -1 --pretty=format:%cd --date=format:'%Y%m%d' ${SHA})
tar cvzf libunicap-0.9.12+repack.git${DATE}.0.${SHA}.tar.gz  libunicap
~~~
